## About MDL - Micro Development Language

When observing the implementation of whole projects making use of MDA, it was diagnosed that to specify and maintain a documentation with the composition of hundreds of Micro-Components making use of standards and frameworks for designer of applications used in the IT market, such as UML, C4 among many others, it was concluded that:
- Drawing and documenting demands a lot of effort, often greater than building some Micro-Component;
- It is necessary to elaborate different designs for each stakeholder besides a meeting to explain to them the drawing;
- Even by making use of agile methodologies involving all stakeholders and the technical team, the lack of visions that made the flow of the business clear, the order in which things happen and the Micro-Components involved, generated gaps in understanding or divergent understandings problems in the application or in its structure.
However, the lack of a ubiquitous notation of understanding and adherence to ceremonies of agile design definitions, generates errors, rework, and significantly increases development time.
And this was the fuel for the creation of a new, ubiquitous, MDA-oriented application designer framework that adheres to agility.

For more information and how to use the model, we strongly encourage you to read the CDM documentation. [MDL Documentation](http://aboutmda.com/mdl.html#contextViews)
